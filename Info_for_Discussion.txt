Trajectory Planning : 
Using Rishi's planner
- optimization based approach 
- error function... minimizing the position error and by vector error
- adding constraint in the form of bz alignment within specific angle
- WORKING FINE FOR NOW
- speed calculations... around 0.1 sec for one point  (using mex in the back)
- planner currently does not have velocity, continuity or any other constraint

Using GUI
- very small changes are done in the gui so that it does not throw any errors
- for now, it is click based method for UI and using the same method of projection
- working fine for now
- spits xyz-bxbybz wrt robot base

- what to do when ik fails at certain points intermediate
- do we have to break the trajectory...if yes how ?..move up or what
- for all line (traj) we go up to some home pt and start nect traj again
- rishi working on velocity constraint
- mesh collision
